# Project Guidelines

## Requirements Documents (docs/requirements.md)

Requirements should describe **WHAT** needs to be done, not **HOW** to implement it.

### Rules for requirements:

1. **No duplication** - each concept is described in one place only
2. **No implementation details** - no code, no specific implementation steps, no function/contract names
3. **No contradictions** - information in different sections must not contradict each other
4. **No obvious things** - don't repeat the same thing in different words

### What should NOT be in requirements:
- Solidity code
- Function signatures
- Contract inheritance
- Step-by-step algorithms (a, b, c, d, e...)
- Implementation details (which libraries to use, how to call functions)

### What SHOULD be in requirements:
- Purpose and goals of the system
- External dependencies
- Roles and their capabilities
- Business logic and rules
- Configuration parameters
- Risks
- Open questions
